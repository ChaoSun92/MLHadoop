This is implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier on Hadoop using MapReduce.

The example input that I have used in this project is file which tells us about a student's activity given certain factors.
So the factors are (in order): Deadline?, Is there a Party?, Is he/she lazy? and finally the output is Activity.

The correct output for this example has also been uploaded.
 
The algorihm takes in three arguments:

1. The test input as a string of comma separated values for which you want to predict the activity for that particular person.

2. The path for the input.

3. The path for the output.
