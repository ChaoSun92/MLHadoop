This algorithm is called "Common Friends" algorithm.
As the name suggests, it helps to find common items between entities.

In this case, the sample input file is a file which stores the user_id of a person and user_ids of all its friends in the fllowing format:

<person_id>,<friend1_id> <friend2_id>....

Each person's user_id is separated by a comma from the friends' user_ids and friends' user_ids are separated by spaces.

The sample output stores the user_ids of two persons and their mutual friends in the following fashion:

<person1_id>,<person2_id>	<friend1_id>,<friend2_id>...|<count>

The two persons' user_ids are separated by a comma and from the friends' user_ids and counts by a tab.
The mutual friends' user_ids are separated by commas and from count of the mutual friends by a "|"


This algorithm takes in only two arguments:

1. The input path
2. The output path
